This project has significantly enhanced my Java skills, particularly in utilizing the Swing library for building user interfaces. The project covers the following features:

1.Layouts: Discovering and using different types of layout managers to organize graphical components.

2.ImplementsListeners: Implementing listeners to handle user events such as mouse clicks, keyboard input, etc.

3.Menubar: Creating and using menu bars to organize commands and application options.

4.Toolbar: Integrating toolbars to provide quick access to commonly used features.

5.PopupMenuSample: Using context menus to display contextual options in response to specific user actions.

6.JSplitPaneSample: Utilizing JSplitPane components to split the window into two resizable panels.

7.Curvetracer: Implementing a curve tracing example to illustrate the graphical capabilities of Java Swing.

8.ActionSample: Using the Action interface to encapsulate user interface actions with predefined properties.

This project aims to provide a practical and interactive approach to mastering Java Swing concepts through concrete examples and targeted exercises.
